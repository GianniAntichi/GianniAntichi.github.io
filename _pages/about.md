I am an Associate Professor at Dipartimento Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria of Politecnico di Milano (Italy) and Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) at the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science of Queen Mary University of London.

My research interests cover a broad spectrum of topics in both **networks** and **systems**. Specifically, end-host network stacks, programmable hardware and network monitoring. Details of my publications can be found on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3VedTqcAAAAJ&hl=en) or my [publications page](/publications/).

My research has been awarded with the best paper at ACM SIGCOMM 2017, the UK Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) New Investigator, the Facebook Networking Systems Research 2020, the ACM SIGCOMM 2020 Student Research competition with [Sebastiano Miano](https://sebymiano.github.io/) and the ACM CoNEXT best poster 2021.

I am *always* looking for motivated students. If you have interests similar to mine, feel free to reach out!
