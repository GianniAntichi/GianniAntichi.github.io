The project <i>CHORYS</i> will be funded by the <b>EU Horizon</b> framework! For the next four years, we will seek to rethink the design of accelerators alongside network and storage stacks for data-intensive applications in the cloud! I will be looking for PhD students and researchers to join the effort!
